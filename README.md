# Knock Out ðŸ¤œ

**Knock Out** is a digital solution for managing a unique Magic: The Gathering Commander meta-format. This system automates the process of assigning players to pods, tracking knockouts, and dynamically creating new games as players return to the pool.


## The Format

The "Knock Out" format adds an exciting twist to the traditional Magic: The Gathering Commander experience. Here's how it works:

1. **Pod Assignment**:
   - All players are randomly assigned to tables (or "pods") of 4 players.
   - Each pod plays a standard Commander game.

2. **Knockout Mechanic**:
   - When a player is eliminated from their game, they are "Knocked Out."
   - Knocked-out players are returned to the **player pool**.

3. **Dynamic Pod Creation**:
   - As players return to the pool, the system monitors availability.
   - When 4 players are available in the pool, a new pod is created, and the cycle begins again.

This process repeats until all games are completed, making it a scalable and dynamic system for tournaments or casual events.

## Features
- **Dynamic Pod Assignment**: Players are randomly assigned to Commander pods for each round.
- **Knockout Management**: Tracks player eliminations and returns them to the pool.
- **Automated Game Creation**: Automatically generates new pods when enough players are available.
- **Cross-Platform Accessibility**: Start with a web-based MVP and expand to phone apps for iOS and Android.
- **Scalable Architecture**: Supports both local playgroups and larger Commander tournaments.

### Diagram Explanation:
1. **Epics** are represented as `subgraph` nodes, with their titles clearly labeled.
2. **PBIs** are listed as individual nodes branching off from their respective Epic.
3. The structure is straightforward, emphasizing the relationship between each Epic and its PBIs.
